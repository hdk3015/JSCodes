ECMAScript is a scripting language specification standardized by ECMAScript International.
It is used by applications to enable client-side scripting.

Javscript -- Developed by Brandan Eich, a developer aat NEtscape corporation,
1995.

ECHMA Script6's Implementations discussed here covers the following New features ::

-> Support for constants.
-> Block Scope
-> Arrow function
-> Extended Parameter handling.
->Template Literals
->Extended Literals
->Enhanced Object Properties
->De-structuring Assignments
->Modules
->Classes
->Iterators
->Generators
->Collections
->New Built in methods for various Classes
->Promises 


Prerequisites : : 


1. Node.Javscript
   download & Install--> https://nodejs.org/en/download

2. Any Code editor /*Recommended*/ - Visual Studio Code

   download & Install--> https://code.visualstudio.com

 
Syntax : :

A Javscript program can be composed of -->

*Variables(Named memory block that can store values for the program)

*Literals(Represents constant/fixed Values).

finally 	for 	enum 	Export
while 	void 	this 	New
null 	super 	Catch 	let
static 	return 	True 	False

*Module - Represents code block that can be reused across different
programs/scripts.

*Comments 
*Identifiers -

Set of valid Identifiers .. 
firstName
first_name
num1
$result

*JS is case-sensitive
